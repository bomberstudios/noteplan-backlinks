# NotePlan Backlinks

This script automates the creation of backlinks between NotePlan notes.

Currently it only supports Notes, but I will implement backlinks for Calendar entries soon (because I need them, basically).

Disclaimer: I take absolutely no responsibility for any data loss. I assume you have backups, and know that running random code from the internet against your valuable data is generally considered a bad idea. Having said that, I use this with my own data and it _seems_ to work ðŸ¤ž

## Usage

- Download the `backlinks.rb` file somewhere to your disk
- Open a Terminal, and run `ruby backlinks.rb`

## Customization

By default, backlinks will be added at the end of your notes, with this format:

```

â™»ï¸Ž Backlinks
- [[Link One]]
- [[Link Two]]
- [[Link Three]]
â™»ï¸Ž Backlinks
```

To change it, edit the `BACKLINKS_MARKER` constant in the first line of `backlinks.rb`

The script assumes your Notes are synced using iCloud. If you're using Dropbox, you'll want to adjust the path in `PATH_TO_NOTEPLAN`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support Calendar notes
